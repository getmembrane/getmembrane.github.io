                <h4 class="faq_question">Why is this better than traditional banning?</h4>
                <p class="faq_answer">Banning users often relies on either usernames, ip numbers or cookies. That is either to wide or to easy to get around. Our tracking is beyond that, it's much more reliable. We weigh in cookies, ip, fingerprinting the browser, triangulation of mobile phones, browsing behaviour and some other stuff to produce a probabilty of how sure we are that you are you. Since there are many sites using our service, trolls moving between sites are banned from the entire network in one go.</p>

            <div class="faq_item">
                <h4 class="faq_question">I don't want other sites to affect my users.</h4>
                <p class="faq_answer">You can configure all that in our admin panel. Perhaps you would only like to weed out the worst haters that have been banned at multiple sites on several occasions. Or perhaps you don't want to use information from other sites and only like your own sites to be included in the calculations. Easy, just configure that then.</p>

            <div class="faq_item">
                <h4 class="faq_question">Why are you doing this?</h4>
                <p class="faq_answer">Lets just say we have seen the problem with haters close up. It's a tricky problem to solve and we believe this could be a part of creating a more friendly web. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq_item">
                <h4 class="faq_question">What will happen if I reach the monthly limit?</h4>
                <p class="faq_answer">Our API will simply begin answering that you have reached your limit. Nothing bad happens, everything will work as if you weren't using our service.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq_item">
                <h4 class="faq_question">What if your service has downtime?</h4>
                <p class="faq_answer">Then the asynchronous calls to our API will fail and users won't notice anything. But we pride our selves in building reliable code on tested platforms, so far uptime is close to 100 %.</p>

                <h4 class="faq_question">Is this something for me?</h4>

            <div class="faq_item">
                <h4 class="faq_question">Ok this seems good, what's the catch?</h4>
                <p class="faq_answer">Haters attack in multiple channels at once. We can't protect you in all of them, yet. But at least we'll lessen the burden in some.</p>
