                <h4 class="faq_question">Why is this better than traditional banning?</h4>
                <p class="faq_answer">Banning users often relies on usernames, ip numbers or cookies. That is either to wide or to easy to get around. Our tracking is beyond that, it's much more reliable. Also since there are many sites using our service, trolls moving between sites are banned from the entire network in one go.</p>

            <div class="faq_item">
                <h4 class="faq_question">I want to ban my own users.</h4>
                <p class="faq_answer">You can configure lots of useful stuff in our admin panel. Like how many times, or at how many sites, a user has to be banned before being flagged. Or at what sites the user has to be banned, in effect configuring what sites should be included in your own network.</p>

            <div class="faq_item">
                <h4 class="faq_question">What will happen if I reach the monthly limit?</h4>
                <p class="faq_answer">Our API will simply begin answering that you have reached your limit. Nothing bad happens, everything will work as if you weren't using our service.</p>

                <p class="faq_answer">Then the asynchronous calls to our API will fail and users won't notice anything. But we pride our selves in building reliable code on tested platforms, so far uptime is close to 100 %.</p>
